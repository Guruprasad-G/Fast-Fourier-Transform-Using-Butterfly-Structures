To Implement

1) New User enters the webpage:- A welocme message pop up with what this website is about?
2) Default entered screen :- DFT calculation webpage
3) Nav Bar with WebsiteName and/or Logo, DFT page link, About us page
4) About us page contains, Cards with Pic and details + Unique visitors count
5) DFT page contains - First card having what the user intends to calculate, i.e DFT or FFT and how many point DFT,
in what methond...
Second card containing Input fields along with option to give imaginary input
Validate if the inuts and the method tie in together. Say if the user gives imaginary input to calculate DFT,
it should throw an error reflected as a popup
Third card displays the Butterfly structure.
6) Advertisements present only in DFT page. Side Adverts and a bottom pop and close advert.

Progress :-
Day 1
1) Translated code from Python to JS
2) Renderd a Nav Menu
3) Tested IDFT using DIT method. Got results similar to Python script, except two values were interchanged.
The last few values had a significant deviation from actual answer back in the python script. I think similar error is 
there in JS output too. (Need to figure out how to solve this, Why such an error is occuring !!)
4) Created a Form for user Input -- Needs Improv
5) Installed react-d3-graph library using which we can render the butterfly structures
